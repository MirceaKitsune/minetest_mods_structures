- Add a system for nodes with inventories (chests, furnaces, etc) to randomly add items to them, each item with a given probability + count. Will allow chests and furnaces in buildings to have random stuff in them.

- Add debug messages. When the preference is set to 1, only print normal messages and errors. When set to 2, print everything important the code is doing.

- When spawning a group, don't determine columns and rows by the number of total buildings. Instead determine them by adding the maximum size of all buildings and extracting the square root, and have each building "cut" the size from the current row while the largest building cuts the size of the column space. This allows for example to have 4 large buildings on one row but 5 smaller ones on the next row.

- Group avoidance radius should depend on the overall size the current group had (detected after spawning all structures), not be a fixed setting.

- Try to center structure spawning around around the group trigger origin.

- Create a road system, which places roads between structures. To do this we'll need a system in the structure manager (via formspec) to register some structures as road segments, road intersections, and road ends. In the mpgen code, we need to choose multiple points in the group (where we determine building positions) and loop road segments to connect them. Since the start of a road will be higher / lower than its end, each segment should go up / down by 1 node in the needed pattern to reach that destination. If there's no way to incline the road enough to reach both points, abort making a road there. When no roads are registered for a mapgen group, make none. This should be added in another lua file.

- A wall system which surrounds the area / range of the group. The structure manager (formspec) must allow registering wall segments, wall corners / connections, and gates. Like the roads idea, walls would only be spawned if any are registered for that mapgen group. Should be done in its own lua file once again.
