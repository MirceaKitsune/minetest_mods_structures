- Find a way to use schematic probabilities, to make some nodes only appear sometimes each spawn (eg: flowers in houses). For this we need a way to set them for specific nodes... perhaps when clicking them with an I/O Marker?

- Add a system for nodes with inventories (chests, furnaces, etc) allowing items to be added to them, using the metadata system.

- Add debug messages. When the preference is set to 1, only print normal messages and errors. When set to 2, print everything important the code is doing.

- Add support for multiple floors on buildings. When the option is greater than 0, the normal building file (eg: structure.mts) is looped vertically. The start schematic is suffixed with _S and the end with _E (eg: structure_S.mts, structure_E.mts). There should also be a new metadata parameter which passes the floor number.

- Allow towns to be generated via console command, not just by exploring. The command requires a privilege, takes group name as input (if none is specified choose randomly), and creates the town at the player's origin. In this case we no longer build a floor or care if the group's trigger node was found.

- Re-implement the ability to edit the mapgen text file via formspec, but this time just use a text editor on the file.

- Consider making collision detection also account height, so that buried / floating buildings and roads can avoid buildings they wouldn't intersect in height. We should also detect if such structures might contribute to the vertical size of the group, considering they'd only avoid structures of intersecting height.

- Refractor the mapgen system so that a city isn't spawned all at once. Instead, each building and road segment is added to a table (as position + scale + angle + etc) and on_generated places the buildings in its range each time. But how would we know the average level of the city's floor, or how to even decide where we place the city?
