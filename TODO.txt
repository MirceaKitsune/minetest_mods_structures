- Add a bury option to the mapgen. When positive structures go in the ground by that many nodes, when negative they float by that many nodes. If not 0, don't check terrain roughness and don't make a floor or cut the border.

- Allow multiple trigger nodes to be specified for a structure, possibly as a comma separated string

- Add a system for nodes with inventories (chests, furnaces, etc) to randomly add items to them, each item with a given probability + count. Will allow chests and furnaces in buildings to have random stuff in them.

- Add debug messages. When the preference is set to 1, only print normal messages and errors. When set to 2, print everything important the code is doing.

- Try to center structure spawning around around the group trigger origin.

- Create a road system, which places roads between structures. To do this we'll need a system in the structure manager (via formspec) to register some structures as road segments, road intersections, and road ends. In the mpgen code, we need to choose multiple points in the group (where we determine building positions) and loop road segments to connect them. Since the start of a road will be higher / lower than its end, each segment should go up / down by 1 node in the needed pattern to reach that destination. If there's no way to incline the road enough to reach both points, abort making a road there. When no roads are registered for a mapgen group, make none. This should be added in another lua file.

- A wall system which surrounds the area / range of the group. The structure manager (formspec) must allow registering wall segments, wall corners / connections, and gates. Like the roads idea, walls would only be spawned if any are registered for that mapgen group. Should be done in its own lua file once again.
