-- Default town for the Structures mod
-- Metadata: $POSITION_X, $POSITION_Y, $POSITION_Z, $SIZE_X, $SIZE_Y, $SIZE_Z, $ANGLE, $NUMBER, $NAME, $GROUP

-- Settings

-- spawning is delayed by this many seconds per structure
-- higher values give more time for other mapgen operations to finish and reduce lag, but cause towns to appear more slowly
-- example: if the delay is 0.1 and a town has 1000 structures, it will take the entire town 100 seconds to spawn
structures.mapgen_delay = 0.25
-- whether to keep structures in the table after they have been placed by on_generate
-- enabling this uses more resources and may cause overlapping schematics to be spawned multiple times, but reduces the chances of structures failing to spawn
structures.mapgen_keep_structures = false
-- multiply the size of the virtual cube (determined by the largest town) by this amount
-- larger values decrease town frequency, but give more room for towns to be sorted in
structures.mapgen_cube_multiply_horizontal = 1
structures.mapgen_cube_multiply_vertical = 2
